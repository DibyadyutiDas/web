## 💻 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DibyadyutiDas/web.git

    ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

> 💡 Tip: For full functionality, use a local server (e.g., `python -m http.server`).

## 🛠️ Development

- **CSS:** Organized by components; feel free to use preprocessors or BEM methodology.
- **JS:** Structured in modules — keep code clean, reusable, and well-documented.
- **Extensions:** Add libraries or frameworks as needed (React, Vue, Sass, etc.).

## 🚧 Roadmap & Ideas

- Integrate build tools (Webpack, Parcel)
- Add unit testing (Jest) and linters (ESLint, Stylelint)
- Convert styles to Sass/SCSS for maintainability
- Explore PWA capabilities and accessibility improvements
